# TM Exam

Trademarks examining attorneys review trademark filings in a platform called TM Exam. There are numerous groups who use the platform, and each group has a slightly differently-designed version.

### The challenge

Our customer experience team was asked to identify key tasks different groups of TM Exam users complete to help prioritize IT resources and funnel them to critical improvements on the platform.

### What we did 

I collaborated with a colleague to engage 23 attorneys in task analysis interviews to observe them as they walked us through key work tasks. We identified key tasks, current workarounds to challenges, and highlighted critical issues that users experience. 

We synthesized notes across interviews on a digital whiteboard, identifying themes that emerged, and build three task-focused journey maps based on the key tasks that emerged within each of the three user groups. 

### What we learned

We were able to present our journey maps and a large prioritization matrix for feature improvements to leadership, resulting in additional IT resources being slotted towards TM Exam for improvements in the upcoming year. 

 This was also an exciting project because it demonstrated the criticality of trust-building at the USPTO: this was the first project where we were able to interview unionized production-schedule employees within Trademarks.
