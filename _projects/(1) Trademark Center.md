# Trademark Center

I lead research for Trademark Center, the USPTO's new trademark filing platform.

Trademark Center went live in January 2025, but we've continued to develop features as we were on continuously improving the platform.

### The challenge 

Trademark Center was released with security-focused features that have challenged users who are used to flexible sharing of application drafts. My ongoing analysis of survey data from customers indicated significant frustration with our sharing features.

With pressure from leadership, our team developed a draft sharing method we wanted to test with an ultimate goal of balancing flexibility of sharing drafts with the security-focused features we needed.

<i>In a resource- and time-constrained environment, how might we ensure that critical feature enhancements are discoverable and meet customer expectations?</i>

### What we did

In a 4-week research cycle, I worked together with our UX designer to refine a design for sharing application drafts via link with associated lawyers or paralegals on Trademark Center. 

Because of shifting leadership priorities, we designed while our engineering team developed, and we knew we'd have limited time to deliver research insights prior to deployment.

### What we learned 

We ultimately tested a prototype of the sharing feature with four paralegals and five trademark attorneys, identifying time-sensitive changes to the design that were implemented before deployment.

This was a great exercise in scaffolding research learnings towards short- and long-term implementation and establishing the feasibility of quick turnaround analysis and presentation (<3 days turnaround for critical updates).
