# Trademarks customer journey mapping

Trademarks engaged a consultancy to build out a customer journey map 10 years ago. Between then and now, we've built out an internal customer experience team, and we wanted to refresh the original map with new insights.

### The challenge

Trademarks employees work in silos, don't often know what other teams are working on, and have differing perspectives on customer needs.

<i>Who are our customers and how do they reach the USPTO?</i>


<i>How might we better support our customers through their trademark filing processes?</i>

### What we did 

We interviewed 14 internal stakeholders and 10 external customers as our first round of research, synthesizing our research together along a rough timeline of the filing process.

We then developed a high-level experience map that identified pain points along the Trademark filing journey.

### What we learned

We learned that scams and fraud are rampant and Trademarks customers are being impacted at levels far beyond what occured in 2015. 

This has helped us prioritize research for FY25 focusing on the prevalence of scams and fraud as we consider how to better communicate about the issue proactively with customers.
