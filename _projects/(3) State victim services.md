# State victim services

Survivors of violent crimes are often eligible for state-sponsored care, but many states s truggle to connect survivors to services.

### The challenge

A state approached our team to engage in a discovery sprint and look into why they had lower numbers of applicants to their victim compensation program in recent years despite higher rates of violent crime in the state.

### What we did 

When diving into research, we quickly realized that because of how sensitive the work was, it was critical to engage in research in-person.

<ol>
	<li>We engaged more than 40 individuals, survivors, advocates, police officers, and social workers in interviews.</li>
	<li>All interviews were done with two researchers, one to take notes and one to solely focus on the participant. We intentionally <b>did not record</b> interviews to preserve participant privacy.</li>
	<li>We worked through networks supporting survivors to recruit people indirectly and met people where they were already accessing services.</li>
</ol>

### What we learned

##### Project takeaways
Awareness of the program was not the only problem facing the state. Survivors of crimes are often expected to be applying for assistance while experiencing trauma, and the program itself needed to become more survivor-centered for the public's perception to change.

##### Our team's reflections
This was a challenging one: the agency did not want to make changes we recommended and wasn't open to mindset shifts on their own programming. We felt real tension when working with them. 

This brought up a question for us: <i> if an organization isn't open to research results that aren't aligned with their hypotheses, how do you deliver value to them?</i>

If we did the project again, we'd probably engage the team in human-centered design exercises earlier so they'd have an idea of what we were doing and why. We'd also work more closely with them up front
