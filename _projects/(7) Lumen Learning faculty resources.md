# Lumen Learning

Lumen Learning is an educational technology startup dedicated to building interactive higher educational courseware. From 2021 to 2022, I led academic and UX research for the company. 

### The challenge

As we designed a new courseware platform, one of the questions I kept coming back to was around faculty resources. What did faculty expect, what did they need, and what would we be able to provide?

### What we did 

I began research by engaging faculty in design workshops centering on brainstorming challenges faculty face in using new courseware and curricula. We then ideated on possible solutions collaboratively.

In a second round of research, we brought back sample resources back to the same faculty members to compare and contrast versions and get their feedback.

### What we learned

Faculty differentiated between three types of resources: implementation resources, teaching resources, and professional learning resources. This helped us assign implementation resources to our Adoption team and make sure teaching and professional learning resources stayed within our content team.
