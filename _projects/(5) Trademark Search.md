# Trademark Search

Trademarks revamped its search platform over the last couple of years to modernize the searching interface. Trademarks customers engage in an in-depth search called a "clearance search" prior to applying to ensure that their proposed mark is available.

### The challenge


In releasing a new search platform, Trademarks shifted the UI and the search syntax to an updated system. This has led to a tension between legal professionals and business owners: generally, business owners have been happy with the new search platform, while legal professionals have found the change harder to adjust to.

### What we did 

I worked on a multi-phase data analysis project for Trademark Search, identifying customer pain points with the new search platform and  I was responsible for survey monitoring, thematic coding of open-ended feedback, and quantitative data analysis. I also looked at statistical differences in customer satisfaction before and after the release of critical features to try to gauge the likelihood of those features contributing to customer satisfaction.

### What we learned
 

Over the months that I supported Trademark Search, I helped identify many areas forward based on customer pain points. Unfortunately, the team was told they needed to enter a maintenance phase on the product while supporting other more critical products; this meant that over time, I had to prioritize feature improvements very deliberately to ensure the team had bandwidth to implement meaningful product changes.

For me, this project was about finding small wins for customers based on bugs and issues reported to the team.
