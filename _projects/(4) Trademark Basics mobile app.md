# Trademark Basics mobile app

Trademarks developed a mobile app a few years ago to be used as a learning opportunity for business owners and entrepreneurs considering filing to register a trademark.

### The challenge

With shifts in software development priorities, our team deployed a survey to try to gather information about users' expectations for a Trademarks app.

### What we did 

I analyzed the survey data by using both descriptive statistics for general quantitative summaries of the data and by thematically coding open-ended survey questions.

### What we learned

Customer expectations for a mobile app <b>did not</b> line up with developer intentions. Customers expected an app that would allow them to engage directly with trademarks via searching and filing, but the internal team intended to build a standalone library of trademarks resources. 

This misalignment led me to recommend that the app be pulled from the app store and sunsetted in order to allow the reassignment of IT resources to other more critical projects; this has now occured.
