# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:!<br>

I'm a UX researcher based in Baltimore, MD, currently working on improving customer experience at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/">USPTO</a>.

Before this, I freelanced as a UX researcher and worked in strategy consulting. I also led research at <a href="http://lumenlearning.com/">Lumen Learning</a>.

I worked at the <a href="https://www.tsl.mit.edu/">MIT Teaching Systems Lab</a> while I did my master's degree at MIT and my bachelor's in physics at <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/">Bowdoin College</a>.
