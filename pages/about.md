# **About Me**

Hi! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>


I’m an experienced researcher based in Baltimore, MD working at the intersection of traditional UX research, customer experience, and quantitative data analysis.

I received most of my research training at MIT while pursuing my master’s degree and working at the <a href="https://tsl.mit.edu/">MIT Teaching Systems Lab</a> as a researcher.

I’m currently at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> leading research on our new trademark filing platform, Trademark Center.

Before, I was on contract at <a href="https://www.bloomworks.com" target="_blank">Bloom Works</a>, a public interest design firm, and at <a href="http://lumenlearning.com/">Lumen Learning</a>, an educational technology company. In between, I worked in strategy consulting at <a href="https://www.kaiserassociates.com" target="_blank">Kaiser Associates</a>.
